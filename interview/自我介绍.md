## 在空余时间有什么爱好
There are a lot of things that I do in my free time. As people say, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, and I perfectly understand the importand the importance of relaxation after work.
I like sports very much and football is my biggest favor with my mates on weekends, and keep running around the ground for a 
few hours. It makes me physically stronger and totally refreshed.
I also like reading much. Not too many people today can really sit down and read a book for more than 2hours every day. But as I think , reading is a rewarding hobby, as it can make you mentally smarter.
One more thing, I like to travel around. I enjoy talking to new people and get to know new customs and places.
